Rowe, F., Robinson, C., Patias, N. 2021. Sensing Global Changes in the Local Patterns of Energy Consumption in Cities During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
```

This paper analyses changes in urban energy consumption during the early stages of the pandemic for a sample of major global cities. Particularly the paper seeks to:
* measure city-scale changes in energy consumption in response to COVID-19;
* determine the extent of shifts in spatial patterns of intra-urban energy consumption;
* investigate potential explanations for changes in urban energy consumption.
